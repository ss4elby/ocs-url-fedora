# ocs-url for Fedora (Updated RPM)
This repository provides an updated RPM package of ocs-url, a small helper tool used to handle the ocs:// URL scheme from OpenDesktop.org, KDE Store, and compatible sites.
ocs:// links are used to install themes, icon packs, Plasma add-ons, widgets, and other desktop extensions.
The original package was last released for Fedora 20, so this project rebuilds it for modern Fedora systems.

What is ocs-url?
ocs-url is a lightweight utility that launches automatically when you click an ocs:// link.
It retrieves the metadata describing the selected add-on and installs it into your desktop environment.

Features:
Handles ocs:// and ocss:// URLs
Integrates with KDE Plasma and other desktops using OpenDesktop content
Drag-and-drop installation for themes and add-ons
Updated RPM packaging for Fedora 42/43 (x86_64)
